# Pension & Property Planning Tool — User Guide

Welcome to the Pension & Property Planning Tool! This app lets you build a detailed, private financial projection for your household, covering pensions, property, investments, income, and future events. It’s designed to be secure, flexible, and fully under your control, running entirely in your web browser (nothing leaves your computer).

## Key Features

* **All-in-one Household Planning:** Track you, your partner, children, and dependents in one place.
* **Customisable Assets & Income:** Add any property, pension, ISA, salary, rental, or custom category. Assign to individuals, set growth, contributions, start/end dates, and more.
* **Commitments & Outgoings:** Add school fees, living expenses, and other outgoings with custom timing and inflation-linking.
* **Future Events:** Model inheritances, lump sums, or one-off expenses. Events can be linked to assets (e.g., ISA withdrawal, property sale).
* **Scenario Modelling:** Copy your plan and tweak any detail to compare “what ifs” — e.g., early retirement or receiving an inheritance.
* **Net Present & Future Values:** View all results in both today’s money and future (nominal) values, using adjustable assumptions.
* **Yearly Snapshots & Graphs:** See tabular summaries and interactive graphs of cash flow, net worth, and more, year by year.
* **Easy Export/Import:** Download your whole plan or any scenario as a JSON backup or spreadsheet. Re-import at any time.
* **Change History:** Review every change with a built-in git-style timeline. Revert if needed.
* **Runs Locally & Securely:** No cloud storage, no sign-up, no data leaves your device. All files are yours.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Choose your preferred theme for comfortable viewing.
* **British English & GBP:** App uses UK spelling and currency (£) throughout.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the App:** Run the app in your browser. No install required.

6. **Adjust Assumptions:** Set inflation, growth rates, and discount rate for present value calculations. Defaults apply across the plan, but each item can be customised.

## Tips

* **No duplicate names:** Make each person, asset, or event uniquely named.
* **Negative balances:** The app will warn if an asset goes negative (e.g., overdraft or gap), but you can proceed if you wish.
* **Manual Overrides:** For investments or assets, update the projected balance in any year to keep your plan in line with reality.
* **Privacy:** Your plan is only saved on your computer, in a location you choose. Export regularly for backup.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Toggle in the app settings or top bar.
* **British English:** All language and terminology are UK-centric, and currency is always GBP (£).

## Data & Privacy

* **Local Only:** All information stays in your browser and your files. Nothing is sent anywhere else.
* **Export:** Download your whole plan or scenario as a .json file for backup or transfer. Use the spreadsheet (CSV) export for analysis.
* **Import:** Restore from any exported .json plan. You can also start with the provided sample data.
